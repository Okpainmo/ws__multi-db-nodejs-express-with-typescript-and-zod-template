# ws\_\_multi-db-nodejs-express-with-typescript-and-zod-template

This template, is a dedicated web-socket version of the [multi-db-nodejs-express-with-typescript-and-zod-template](https://github.com/Okpainmo/multi-db-nodejs-express-with-typescript-and-zod-template) - a highly flexible, function-based, domain-driven-development(DDD)-inspired NodeJs/Express(with Typescript) template.

> **Before you generate a project with the template, endeavour to check the ["How To Use This Template"](https://github.com/Okpainmo/ws__multi-db-nodejs-express-with-typescript-and-zod-template?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use-this-template) section of this README file(especially the step No. 3 - so you can learn how to effectively untrack the environmental variables before cloning your newly bootstrapped project).**

> **The [Debugging](https://github.com/Okpainmo/multi-db-nodejs-express-with-typescript-and-zod-template?tab=readme-ov-file#debugging) section will also be helpful in case you run into some tricky errors.**

## Features.

> In a way, it honestly feels like a crime to me, for anyone to still go about building systems with vanilla Javascript. This template is **fully typed 💪**. Furthermore, is serves perfectly as a **great option for anyone who already understands Express, and do not intend to switch to a new framework like NestJS**.

- It is set up to utilize a centralized, Zod-validated configuration system that supports multiple database types (MongoDB and PostgreSQL) and multiple working environments.

- To provide usage guidance, the template contains build samples/demonstrations of how to use both databases.

- Inside, you'll find professionally crafted implementations that show how to practically build and ship top-class Node/Express APIs that are fully typed.

- To ensure proper separation of concerns, MongoDB will use Mongoose as ODM, while PostgreSQL will use Prisma as ORM.

- Subsequently, this README file, will contain instructions, on how to fully unplug any of the database setups that you do not wish to use, while retaining the other.

- It also comes with a standard WebSocket implementation(using the `ws` NodeJs library), to enable real-time communication between the client and the server.

> **I created this with so much love(❤️) for myself, and engineering teams I lead/work on.**

> Feel free to bet you life on it.

Below is a more detailed list of the core features of this template.

1. **Domain-Driven Database Selection**: A highly flexible architecture where each domain (E.g. Admin, Auth, User) can be assigned a dedicated database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL). This allows for complex hybrid-data scenarios while maintaining clean, separated service logic.

2. **Modular & Scalable Configuration**: A centralized, Zod-powered configuration system that validates your entire environment on startup. Configuration is split into specialized modules (`db`, `jwt`, `server`, `ws`) and includes domain-specific database mappings.

3. **High-Security Auth Middleware**: A robust, dual-layered security architecture that separates Access and Session management. Includes pre-configured JWT handling and high-security HTTP-only cookie deployment for production-grade authentication.

4. **True Multi-DB Flexibility**: Native support for MongoDB (Mongoose) and PostgreSQL (Prisma). Switch or combine your project's data layers with a single `DATABASE_TYPE` change in your environment file, and fine-tune database usage per domain.

5. **Integrated WebSocket Core**: A professional WebSocket server implementation (using `ws`) included out of the box. Features built-in include: heartbeats, auto-cleanup, and graceful shutdown to ensure real-time stability and a lot more.

6. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: A clean, modular architecture inspired by DDD. All database-related business logic are strictly separated from API routing and controllers, making the codebase a joy to tweak, navigate, and scale - as might be necessary in the future.

7. **Multi-Environment Harmony**: Seamless support for `development`, `staging`, and `production`. Test complex environment-specific configurations locally with ease using isolated `.env` stacks.

8. **Elite Developer Experience**:
   - **Full TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety for rock-solid code.
   - **Automated Quality**: Husky, Lint-staged, and Commitlint are pre-configured to enforce formatting, linting, and commit standards.
   - **Modern Stack**: Powered by **Bun** for lightning-fast package management and execution.

9. **Deployment Ready**: Standardized `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose` templates included, ensuring your app is ready for the cloud from day one.

> Package manager is **`Bun`**.

### High Professional And Beautifully Implemented.

As earlier stated, the template is DDD(domain driven development)-inspired. Hence, it comes with some default - carefully thought-out domains(`auth`, `user`, and `admin`).

With these default domains, you'll get to see how sample end-points are neatly and professionally implemented, providing COMPLETE extraction of ALL DATABASE LOGIC into unified service files.

### One Process, One File

The template utilizes a "One Process, One File" pattern for database operations (e.g., `user.findUser.service.ts`). Each service file handles the internal logic for both MongoDB and PostgreSQL, automatically selecting the correct implementation based on your domain-specific database type settings/selections.

This ensures that business logic remains decoupled from the specific database engine used by each domain.

## Working Environment Support.

> As per working environments, the template supports 3 different environments(development/dev, staging, and production/prod).
>
> **This gives you the massive flexibility of being able to test any of the working environments locally with so much ease.**

### Environment Variables

> The project has 4(four) environmental variable files(which are all intentionally un-ignored), to help you easily understand how the template's environmental variables setup works. **Endeavour to git-ignore them immediately you start/bootstrap a new project**.
>
> 1. `.env` - the CORE/CENTRAL environment variable file that helps with selecting your preferred working environment.
> 2. `.env.development` - environmental variables file for the dev/development environment.
> 3. `.env.staging` - environmental variables file for the staging environment.
> 4. `.env.production` - environmental variables file for the prod/production environment.

> Switching to a different environment is easy: **simply head to the CORE environment file(`.env`), and select your preferred environment by uncommenting it and commenting the others**.
>
> The project uses a dedicated config loader (`src/config/utils/envInit.ts`) that automatically detects this change and loads the corresponding `.env.{environment}` file.

I.e.

```bash
# ...code before

# =========================================================================================================
# The template comes with 4 '.env' files. The main one(`.env) is a core/central environment selection file. All
# it does is to help you select your preferred working environment from one of 'development', 'staging', and 'production'.
#
# All the others are for the three main environments(development, staging, and production) that is assumed you'll
# be working from. This gives you the flexibility to test any of the environments locally with much ease.
#
# Simply un-comment the line for your preferred working/testing environment, and you'll be right on it.
#
# The project has been pre-configured(see `src -> app.ts`) to select one from the 3 .env files based on the
# environment you un-comment below. By default, the 'development' environment is un-commented/selected.
#
# BELOW: UN-COMMENT YOUR PREFERRED ENVIRONMENT, AND THE PROJECT WILL SELECT/USE THE CORRESPONDING .env FILE
# ==========================================================================================================

NODE_ENV="development"
# NODE_ENV="production"
# NODE_ENV="staging"

# ...code after
```

### Selecting Database Types.

#### 1. Project-Wide Connections

To select which databases the app should establish connections to during startup, update the `DATABASE_TYPE` variable in your active `.env` file:

```bash
# Options: "mongodb", "postgresql", or "mongodb, postgresql"
DATABASE_TYPE="mongodb, postgresql"
```

#### 2. Domain-Specific Assignment

Assign a specific database engine to each domain. This dictates which database the domain's services will use for all operations:

```bash
# Options: "mongodb" | "postgresql"
DATABASE_TYPE_ADMIN=postgresql
DATABASE_TYPE_AUTH=mongodb
DATABASE_TYPE_USER=mongodb
```

The system will automatically use the correct logic for each domain based on these mappings.

## How To Use This Template.

1. Using this template is simple. The main criteria being that you know how to use typescript, and that you have Docker installed on your machine.

2. Create/Bootstrap a project repository(using this as a template).

3. Before you clone - while still on Github(from your github interface), copy out and carefully save the contents of all the respective environmental variables files(`.env`, `.env.development`, `.env.staging`, and `.env.production`), then delete all of them - still using the github interface.

> **This step is necessary, to help untrack all the(intentionally added) environmental variables files, and enable you re-create and have them ignored with Git, after you clone your newly bootstrapped project**.

4. Now clone your project, and settle in to start working

```bash
git clone your-project-url

cd your-project-name
```

5. Re-create all the environmental variables files earlier deleted - this time, you're sure not to have any issues with git-ignoring them, since they are no longer being tracked.

6. Proceed to install all dependencies and dev-dependencies.

**with current project versions**:

```bash
npm install
```

**or, with new version installations(ensure to delete the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files first)**:

```bash
# dependencies
npm install axios bcryptjs cookie-parser cors dayjs dotenv express mongoose nodemailer pino zod @prisma/client mongodb bcrypt jsonwebtoken @prisma/adapter-pg pg ws

# dev-dependencies
npm install @types/cookie-parser @types/cors @types/express @types/node @types/nodemailer @typescript-eslint/parser prisma eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier lint-staged pino-pretty prettier ts-node tsx typescript dotenv-cli @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @eslint/js husky @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional @types/bcrypt @types/jsonwebtoken @types/ws @types/pg --save-dev
```

7. Pull in the mongodb and postgresql docker images

```bash
docker pull mongodb/mongodb-community-server # mongodb
```

```bash
docker pull postgres # postgres
```

8. Setup and start the databases.

**Option 1a: start them individually(PostgreSQL)**.

```bash
# update the start command to suit your setup, and start databases for all the 3 environments using docker.

docker run -d --name container-name -p 543x:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=your-user-name -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-password -e POSTGRES_DB=database-name postgres
```

E.g.

```bash
# for dev:

docker run -d --name multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__postgres_dev -p 5433:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=your-user-name -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-password -e POSTGRES_DB=multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__db_dev postgres
```

```bash
# for staging:

docker run -d --name multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__postgres_staging -p 5434:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=your-user-name -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-password -e POSTGRES_DB=multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__db_staging postgres
```

```bash
# for prod:

docker run -d --name multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__postgres_prod -p 5435:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=your-user-name -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-password -e POSTGRES_DB=multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__db_prod postgres
```

**Option 1b: start them individually(MongoDB)**.

```bash
# update the start command to suit your setup, and start databases for all the 3 environments using docker.

docker run --name container-name -p 2701x:27017 -d mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest
```

E.g.

```bash
# for dev:

docker run --name multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__mongo_dev -p 27017:27017 -d mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest
```

```bash
# for staging:

docker run --name multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__mongo_staging -p 27018:27017 -d mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest
```

```bash
# for prod:

docker run --name multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__mongo_prod -p 27019:27017 -d mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest
```

> P.S: starting docker postgres and mongodb instances for `staging` and `prod` may not be necessary since you would want to use real(remotely provisioned) databases for those.

**Option 2: update the `docker-compose.yaml` file on the project's root, using either the `docker-compose.postgres.template.yaml` or the `docker-compose.mongo.template.yaml` file as a guide - depending on the database type you wish to use. Then start all the databases at once**.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

CONNECT YOUR DATABASES TO A POSTGRESQL GUI SOFTWARE/SERVICE - E.G PGADMIN(OR A SIMILAR, E.G MONGODB COMPASS - FOR MONGODB), TO VIEW THEM.

9. Start your main app/API server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

If successfully connected, depending on your database type(s) configuration, you will see a response similar to the one below - inside your terminal.

```bash
[06:23:32.000] INFO: Establishing database connection(s)
[06:23:32.000] INFO: ...................................
Connected to: localhost
Environment: development

MongoDB connected successfully
........................................................
[06:23:32.000] INFO: ...................................
WebSocket server is listening on port 5000
WebSocket: ws://localhost:5000/ws

HTTP server is listening on port 5000
HTTP: http://localhost:5000

Environment: development
........................................................
```

Your API server should start up and be accessible via port 5000 - `http://localhost:5000`. On visiting it, a Pretty-print response like the one below indicates that you're started and all good to go.

```json
{
  "responseMessage": "Welcome to the Multi DB Node/Express... server",
  "response": {
    "apiStatus": "OK - Server is live"
  }
}
```

10. Take a deep breath, reward yourself with a coffee break, and return to hack on.

## Prisma-specific Guides.

Normally, Prisma interacts directly(by default) with a `.env` file that should be on the project root, hence would not know if to use a different(custom) environment variables file - as it actually should for this template. Since this template maintains a decentralized environmental variables file structure, the `dotenv-cli` package(a package that should already be installed at the project dependencies-installation stage - if you followed the instructions properly), is used to specify which environmental variables file to use against prisma commands.

Below is a sample command for running a migration against the PostgreSQL database in Prisma dev mode.

```bash
npx dotenv -e .env.development -- npx prisma migrate dev --name migration-name
```

E.g.

```bash
npx dotenv -e .env.development -- npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

And this for regenerating the Prisma client.

```bash
npx dotenv -e .env.development -- npx prisma generate
```

## Transpiling From Typescript To Javasctipt.

The project as stated earlier, is typescript-heavy. To build(transpile) your project into raw Javascript(with the same exact structure as the TS version) - for deployment or for any other necessary purpose, simply use the build command below.

```bash
npm run build
```

The above commands, transpiles all TS into JS for your project. A **"build"** folder will appear if the command is successfully.

## Building The Template With Docker.

The template comes with a pre-configured `Dockerfile`, and a `.dockerignore`. With these, building it into a Docker image becomes as easy as running the command below.

```bash
docker build -t your-project-name .
```

E.g.

```bash
docker build -t multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__docker .
```

> A great way to run the project, would be to set-up a docker-compose configuration that builds the app/server, and starts up the database(s) - all with one single command. This will provide much ease for team-mates(especially seniors and leads) who only wish to assess/test the development progress - and not to contribute.

**SEE `docker-compose.mongo.template.yaml` AND `docker-compose.postgres.template.yaml` FOR HELP.**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Below are some sample Docker commands to manually start a container that is running the image.

**P.S: The below commands, are quite a combination. They assume that your databases are running on a docker network called - `multi-db-nodejs-express-with-typescript-and-zod-template_backend_net`. They also require an understanding of Docker networking, and what happens when you're trying to connect a stand-alone docker container to database instances that are running inside other docker containers.**.

```bash
# dev

docker run -d \
  --env-file .env.development \
  -p 5001:5000 \
  --name multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__docker_dev \
  --network multi-db-nodejs-express-with-typescript-and-zod-template_backend_net \
  -e MONGO_DB_URI="mongodb://your-user-name:your-password@multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__mongo_dev:27017/multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__db_dev?authSource=admin" \
  -e POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your-user-name:your-password@multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__postgres_dev:5432/multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__db_dev?schema=public" \
  multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__docker
```

```bash
# staging

docker run -d \
  --env-file .env.staging \
  -p 5002:5000 \
  --name multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__docker_staging \
  --network multi-db-nodejs-express-with-typescript-and-zod-template_backend_net \
  -e MONGO_DB_URI="mongodb://your-user-name:your-password@multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__mongo_staging:27017/multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__db_staging?authSource=admin" \
  -e POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your-user-name:your-password@multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__postgres_staging:5432/multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__db_staging?schema=public" \
  multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__docker
```

```bash
# prod

docker run -d \
  --env-file .env.production \
  -p 5003:5000 \
  --name multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__docker_prod \
  --network multi-db-nodejs-express-with-typescript-and-zod-template_backend_net \
  -e MONGO_DB_URI="mongodb://your-user-name:your-password@multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__mongo_prod:27017/multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__db_prod?authSource=admin" \
  -e POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your-user-name:your-password@multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__postgres_prod:5432/multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__db_prod?schema=public" \
  multi_db_nodejs_express_with_typescript_template__docker
```

## Enforcing Coding(Contribution) Standards/Rules.

This template is built to support the best industry standards available. Hence enforcing code quality was a core focus.

1. For linting, **ESlint** is used. See `eslint.config.mjs` for all the ESlint configurations.

To lint your project manually, simply run the below command:

```bash
npx eslint .
```

2. For code formatting, **Prettier** was used. See `.prettierrc` and `.prettierignore`, for all the Prettier configurations.

To format your project manually, simply run the below command:

```bash
npx prettier . --write
```

3. As can be seen so far(if left that way), linting and code-formatting would be manual, hence collaborating developers can easily forget to run the necessary checks before pushing their contributions to Github.

To solve that issue and more, **Lint-staged**, **Commitlint**, and **Husky** were used.

Lint-staged with the help of Husky, enforces automatic [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) formatting and [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) linting - **on all staged files**.
On the other hand, [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) (also using Husky), helps to enforce rules on commit messages - Making sure that collaborating team members write proper commits.

To run Lint-staged manually on currently staged files, use the command below:

```bash
npx lint-staged
```

> P.S: You do not need to run the `lint-staged` command manually. If you follow all instructions, and set up the template correctly, a pre-commit task would be automatically triggered whenever you try to make any code commit to Github. This would, in turn, lint and format your code automatically, while also ensuring commit standards.
>
> All Lint-staged configurations can be found inside the `.lintstagedrc.json` file.

## Sample End-points.

As earlier stated, the project comes with 3 different domains(the `auth` domain, the `user` domain, and the `admin` domain) that help to demonstrate how to keep things modular, domain-driven, neat, and professional.

Below are the default domains and their sample end-point, which you can build on top of - if you wish.

### Default Domains And Their End-points

1. Admin:

- Endpoints:
  1. De-activate user - `/api/v1/admin/deactivate-user/:userId`

2. Auth:

- Endpoints:
  1. Log-in - `/api/v1/auth/log-in`
  2. Register - `/api/v1/auth/register`

2. User:

- Endpoints:
  1. Get user profile - `/api/v1/user/:userId`
  2. Get all user profiles - `/api/v1/user`

## Debugging.

> This section contains a list of issues you might likely encounter while using this template, and how to fix/handle them.

1. Post-installation script error(see `package.json` for reference).

- Issue: Making a project installations while using a VPN caused the `post-install` process to crash.

```shell
Downloading Prisma engines for debian-openssl-3.0.x [                    ] 0%Error: request to https://binaries.prisma.sh/all_commits/9d6ad21cbbceab97458517b147a6a09ff43aa735/debian-openssl-3.0.x/schema-engine.gz.sha256 failed, reason:
# error: postinstall script from "multi-db-nodejs-express-with-typescript-and-zod-template" exited with 1
```

- Fix: Disable your VPN and try again.
